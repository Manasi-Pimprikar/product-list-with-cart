## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Typescript
- SCSS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - css library


### What I learned

I have learned about the typescript and how I can use and build the ts file to js file, also used scss and learned about how to build the scss file into css file.
I faced the challenge of dynamic updating of the cart when particular product is selected. I somehow managed to complete it from searching from google and other resources.
